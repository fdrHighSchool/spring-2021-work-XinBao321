9.3 Notes
Method overriding occurs when a public method in a subclass has the same method signature as a public method in the superclass.

Any method that is called must be defined within its own class or its superclass.

A subclass is usually designed to have modified (overridden) or additional methods or instance variables.

9.4 Notes

The keyword super can be used to call a superclass’s constructors and methods.

The superclass method can be called in a subclass by using the keyword super with the method name and passing appropriate parameters.

9.5 Notes

An inheritance hierarchy of subclasses inheriting from superclasses can be formed with Object being the top of the hierarchy.

When a class S “is-a” class T, T is referred to as a superclass, and S is referred to as a subclass.

If S is a subclass of T, then a reference of type T can be used to refer to an object of type T or S. This is called polymorphism, defined more in the next lesson.
